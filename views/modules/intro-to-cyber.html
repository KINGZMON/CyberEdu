                <h2>Understanding Cybersecurity</h2>

                <h3>What is Cybersecurity?</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cybersecurity 101:</strong> Think of cybersecurity like a digital bodyguard. It's all about protecting your devices and data from online baddies who want to mess with your stuff.</li>
                    <li><strong>Why it Matters:</strong> In today's digital age, nearly everything we do is online. From social media to online banking, cybersecurity protects our personal information and ensures our digital activities are secure.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Common Threats:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Imagine getting a DM from someone pretending to be your fave celeb, asking for your password. That's phishing—tricking you into giving up your info.</li>
                    <li><strong>Malware:</strong> This is nasty software that can wreck your computer or phone. It's like catching a virus IRL, but for your tech.</li>
                    <li><strong>Identity Theft:</strong> Picture someone stealing your identity and buying stuff with your money. Scary, right? That's why keeping your info safe is a big deal.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Basic Online Safety Practices</h2>
                <h3>Creating Strong Passwords:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Mix It Up:</strong> Use a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. Think "P@ssw0rd!" instead of "password123".</li>
                    <li><strong>Avoid the Obvious:</strong> No pet names or birthdays—those are too easy to guess.</li>
                    <li><strong>Longer is Better:</strong> Go for at least 8 characters. The longer, the better!</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Recognizing Safe Websites:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check for HTTPS:</strong> Only trust sites that start with "https://". The "s" stands for secure, like a secret handshake.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look for the Lock:</strong> A padlock icon in the address bar means the site is secure. No padlock? No deal!</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3>Avoiding Suspicious Links and Emails:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Be Skeptical:</strong> If you get an unexpected email or message, especially asking for your info, think twice. If it smells fishy, it probably is.</li>
                    <li><strong>Hover Before You Click:</strong> Hover over links to see where they lead before clicking. If it looks weird, don’t click!</li>
                </ul>
