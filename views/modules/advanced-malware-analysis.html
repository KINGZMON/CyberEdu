                <h2>What is Malware Analysis?</h2>
                <p>
                    Malware analysis is like being a detective in the digital world, uncovering the mysteries of malicious software. 
                    Whether it’s a virus that crashes your system or a sneaky spyware stealing your passwords, analysing malware is key to defeating it.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Static Analysis:</strong> Imagine examining a suspicious package without opening it. You look at clues like the code and file properties to understand its purpose.</p>
                <p><strong>Dynamic Analysis:</strong> This is like opening the package (in a safe environment) and watching what it does. Does it try to send your data to a remote server? Does it create new files?</p>
                <br>
                <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
                <p>It helps cybersecurity experts understand how malware works and develop ways to stop it, protect systems, and warn others about similar threats.</p>

            <section id="types-of-malware">
                <h2>Types of Malware (The Usual Suspects)</h2>
                <p>Malware comes in many forms, each with its own tricks:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Locks your files and demands payment. Paying up doesn’t always get your data back!</li>
                    <li><strong>Spyware:</strong> Secretly gathers your private information, like passwords or browsing habits.</li>
                    <li><strong>Trojan Horse:</strong> Disguised as something useful (like a free app) but hides malicious code.</li>
                    <li><strong>Adware:</strong> Annoying ads everywhere, sometimes leading to dangerous websites.</li>
                    <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Self-replicating malware that spreads quickly across networks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each type of malware has its own goals, from stealing data to causing chaos.</p>

            <section id="tools-of-the-trade">
                <h2>Tools of the Trade</h2>
                <p>Cybersecurity experts rely on a special toolkit to dissect and neutralise malware:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wireshark:</strong> Captures and analyses network traffic to see what data the malware is sending or receiving.</li>
                    <li><strong>Sandbox Environments:</strong> Virtual machines like Cuckoo Sandbox let you safely run malware to observe its behaviour.</li>
                    <li><strong>Procmon:</strong> Tracks every action malware takes on your system, from creating files to modifying registry keys.</li>
                    <li><strong>IDA Pro/Ghidra:</strong> Reverse-engineering tools to dig into the code and understand its inner workings.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>With these tools, you can uncover what the malware is doing and how to stop it.</p>

                <h2>Real-World Malware Stories</h2>
                <p>Some malware is so infamous it’s like the supervillains of cyberspace:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wannacry Ransomware:</strong> In 2017, it locked files across the globe, including in hospitals and businesses. It spread through unpatched systems. Lesson: Keep your software updated!</li>
                    <li><strong>Pegasus Spyware:</strong> Could turn on your phone’s camera or mic without you knowing. It’s like having a spy in your pocket.</li>
                    <li><strong>ILOVEYOU Virus:</strong> A seemingly harmless “I love you” email that spread to millions in 2000. Lesson: Don’t trust random links or attachments.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Learning from these incidents helps prevent similar attacks in the future.</p>

            <section id="malware-hunter-mindset">
                <h2>The Malware Hunter Mindset</h2>
                <p>To analyse malware effectively, you need the right mindset:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Curiosity:</strong> Treat malware like a puzzle—break it apart to see how it works.</li>
                    <li><strong>Caution:</strong> Always use isolated environments to protect your real devices and data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Patience:</strong> Malware is designed to hide; unravelling its secrets takes time.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>By thinking like a hacker, you can outsmart them and help secure cyberspace for everyone.</p>
