                <h2>Understanding Network Security</h2>
                <h3>What is Network Security?</h3>
                <p>Network security is like having a high-tech bouncer at the entrance of your digital world. It ensures only the right people get in and keeps out the online troublemakers.</p>
                <h3>How Networks Work:</h3><p>Think of a network as a group chat. It's a bunch of devices (phones, laptops, tablets) all talking to each other. Just like in a group chat, you don't want strangers popping in!</p>
                <h3>Why it Matters:</h3>
                <p>You're gaming online, streaming your favourite shows, or just surfing the web. Network security makes sure nobody can snoop on what you're doing or steal your data.</p>

                <h2>Common Network Threats</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Hackers and Cyber Attacks:</strong> Imagine someone trying to break into your house. Hackers do the same thing but with your network. They use sneaky ways to get in and mess with your stuff.</li>
                    <li><strong>DDoS Attacks:</strong> This is like when everyone tries to use the school Wi-Fi at once and it crashes. Hackers overload a website or service to take it down.</li>
                    <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:</strong> Picture this: you're passing notes in class, and someone intercepts them. A man-in-the-middle attack is when a hacker intercepts data being sent between two devices.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Securing Your Network</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Wi-Fi Security:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Strong Passwords:</strong> Use complex passwords for your Wi-Fi. "123456" is a no-go! Think "H@ckTh!s123" instead.</li>
                            <li><strong>WPA3 Encryption:</strong> Ensure your Wi-Fi is using WPA3 encryption. It's like having a super-strong lock on your digital door.</li>
                            <li><strong>Guest Networks:</strong> Set up a guest network for visitors to keep your main network more secure.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls are like digital bodyguards. They monitor incoming and outgoing traffic and block anything suspicious.</li>
                    <li><strong>VPNs (Virtual Private Networks):</strong> Using a VPN is like wearing a disguise online. It hides your IP address and encrypts your data, making it harder for hackers to track you.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Recognising Network Security Risks</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Unsecured Networks:</strong> Be wary of public Wi-Fi, like the one at your favourite caf√©. Hackers can easily access these networks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Suspicious Activity:</strong> If your internet slows down for no reason, or you see strange devices connected to your network, it might be compromised.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phishing on Networks:</strong> Just like email phishing, you can get tricked through network messages. Always verify before clicking links or providing info.</li>
                </ul>
